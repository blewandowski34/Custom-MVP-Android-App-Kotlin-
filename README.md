# NBA-Custom-MVP

This app takes in values from the user from sliders representing each basketball statistic and how much it impacts the MVP candidate calculation. 

By swiping to the right in the top left corner you can open the navigation menu after you set the sliders. 

When the MVP Race fragment opens initially the UI is not updated because the API calls take about 10 seconds to finish and update the UI

After about 10 seconds the UI will update with the top 10 candidates for MVP based on the values you put in for the sliders.
